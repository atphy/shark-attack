# Shark Attack
This was our first exposure to React. The overall functionality is simple: users see a screen with a list of classmates as well as a button which, on click, transfers students from the "shark tank" area to the "dearly departed" area. While there's not a whole lot going on functionally, I'm especially proud of the UI/UX on this one, especially within a new coding context.
